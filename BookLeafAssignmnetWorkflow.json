This is a common occurrence.\nHere’s what you should know:\nYour book is still live and published in our system\n\n\nAmazon may temporarily show “Currently Unavailable” or “Out of Stock”\n\n\nThis typically resolves within 24–48 hours\n\n\n✅ What you should do:\nCheck the listing again after a few hours\n\n\nIf the issue persists beyond 48 hours, raise a support ticket so we can escalate it\n\n\n\n\n🟢 Why Isn’t My Book Marked as “Prime” on Amazon Yet?\nAs soon as your book is listed on Amazon.in, we submit a request for it to be made Prime eligible.\nHowever:\nThe decision and timeline is entirely controlled by Amazon\n\n\nApproval may take time due to their internal review process\n\n\nWe are actively monitoring your listing and will follow up as needed. Thank you for your patience while Amazon finalizes the Prime eligibility.\n\n\n🚚 I Have Amazon Prime — Why Am I Still Being Charged Delivery?\nEven if you're a Prime member, Amazon sometimes applies shipping fees on:\nPrint-on-demand products\n\n\nBooks fulfilled by third-party sellers\n\n\nSince BookLeaf books are POD (print-on-demand), Amazon handles the shipping fee directly.\n📌 We do not control Amazon’s delivery charges and cannot remove them, even for Prime users.\n\n\n\n📦 Post-Publishing Changes (Add-On)\nIf you’ve purchased the Post-Publishing Changes service:\nWe will begin the update process within 4–5 business days after your purchase\n\n\nYou’ll receive access to the draft of your book\n\n\nOnce you make your updates, we’ll re-initiate the publishing and listing process with the updated version of your book.\n🛠️ Our team will guide you through the revision process and ensure your book is updated with your changes.\n\n\n🧾 Publishing Certificate Request\nTo receive your official publishing certificate, please fill out this form:\n 🔗 https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc2q8Npy9bO3zpDuQKiupQP3ALNp_oYDjiEW7I46iSAF9Z64Q/viewform?usp=sf_link\nWe will verify your details and send you the certificate by email.\n\n\n\n\nRoyalty Queries & Sales Reports\n\n📊 How to Check Your Sales Report\nYou can view your sales report online by visiting:\n 🔗 https://ebooks.bookleafpub.com/sales-reports\nOnce on the page, you’ll find three report types:\nLive Sales – BookLeaf Store (eBooks only)\n\n\nSales Report – International Author\n\n\nSales Report – Indian Author\n\n\n🔹 A. Live eBook Sales (BookLeaf Store only)\nThis shows real-time eBook sales on BookLeaf’s online store.\n\n\nYou'll be redirected to a Google Sheet.\n\n\nSelect your book title from the dropdown to view details.\n\n\n🔹 B. Sales Report – Indian & International Authors\nIncludes both paperback and eBook sales across platforms.\n\n\nChoose the appropriate report based on your location.\n\n\n🧾 To use the report:\nEnter your book's ISBN in the white-highlighted column.\n\n\nDelete any pre-filled ISBNs before entering yours.\n\n\nSales data will populate automatically in the adjacent columns.\n\n\n📅 Update Schedule for Sales Reports:\nSales data is sourced directly from the platforms where your book is published.\n\n\nReports are updated monthly, usually after the 15th of each month.\n\n\nThe report is always current up to the month before last month.\n (For example, if today is March 10th, the latest report available would be up to January.)\nFor new authors, the first sales report is available after 45-60 business days since the book goes live.\n\n\n\n\n\n💸 When and How Will I Receive My Royalty Payment?\nRoyalties are paid once your earnings cross a minimum threshold and are processed in a phased manner.\nMinimum Thresholds:\nFor Indian authors: ₹2000\n\n\nFor International authors: $100\n\n\n\nOnce Your Royalty Crosses the Threshold:\nPlease inform us via the helpdesk to initiate your royalty transfer.\n\n\nAfter we verify your eligibility, we’ll send you a Razorpay payout link to your registered email address.\n\n\nCheck both your Inbox and Spam/Junk folders for the email.\n\nHow to Claim Your Royalty:\nClick on the payout link in the email.\n\n\nEnter your UPI ID or bank account details as prompted.\n\n\nYour royalty will be transferred to you accordingly.\n\n\n💡 Note: The payment can take anywhere from 1 minute to 24 hours to reflect in your account, depending on your bank or wallet provider.\nIf you face any issues during this process, please reach out to our support team — we’re always here to assist.\n\nFor authors enrolled in the Bestseller Breakthrough Package, royalties are paid on-demand—meaning you can request a royalty payout anytime after your book has been live for at least 30 business days.\nThis 30-day window allows for:\nCompletion of initial reporting cycles from platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, etc.\nValidation of sales data\nProcessing of any returns or adjustments\n\n📘 eBook & 📗 Paperback Royalty Structure\nWe are committed to full transparency when it comes to your royalty earnings.\nYour detailed sales report (with royalty breakdowns) is available at:\n 🔗 https://ebooks.bookleafpub.com/sales-reports\n\n📘 eBook Royalty:\nYou receive 80% royalty on the net sale price of each eBook sold through our store (unless your package includes 100% royalty).\n\n\nThis ensures that you benefit from most of the profits while keeping the book attractively priced for readers.\n\n\n\n📗 Paperback Royalty:\nPaperback royalty is calculated differently and depends on the following:\nPlatform discounts\n\n\nPrinting cost\n\n\nGST (Goods & Services Tax)\n\n\nPackaging and handling charges\n\n\nDistribution and return expenses\n\n\n💰 Royalty Formula:\nSelling Price – Printing & Market Access Charges = Your Royalty Base\nThen:\nIf you're on the regular publishing model: you get 80% of this amount\n\n\nIf you're on the Bestseller Breakthrough Package: you get 100% of this amount\n\n\nTo calculate your royalty, you can use our Royalty Calculator here:\n 🔗 https://www.bookleafpub.in/printing-cost-royalty-calculator\n\n\n\n❓ What Does “80% Royalty” Mean?\nWhen we say “80% royalty,” it refers to 80% of the profit earned, not 80% of the book's listed price.\nThe book’s listed price includes:\nPrinting cost\n\n\nPlatform fees (e.g., Amazon commission)\n\n\nGST and other taxes\n\n\nHandling and packaging\n\n\nDistribution & return costs\n\n\nPlatform discounts (e.g., Amazon often takes 25–50% off MRP)\n\n\nExample:\nIf your book is listed at ₹150 on Amazon:\n₹40 may go toward printing\n\n\n₹45 may be deducted by Amazon (platform discount + fees + taxes)\n\n\nRemaining profit: ₹65\n\n\nYou’ll receive 80% of ₹65 = ₹52\n\n\nYou can use our royalty calculator for an accurate estimate:\n 🔗 https://www.bookleafpub.in/printing-cost-royalty-calculator\n\n💯 Understanding “100% Royalty” (For Bestseller Breakthrough Authors Only)\nIf you’ve purchased the Bestseller Breakthrough Package, you're eligible for 100% royalty.\nThis means:\nYou receive the entire profit (after deductions) from each sale.\n\n\nYou still don’t receive 100% of the listed price — platform costs and printing still apply.\n\n\nExample:\nIf your book is listed at ₹150:\nPrinting + taxes + fees = ₹60\n\n\nNet profit = ₹90\n\n\nYou’ll receive ₹90 as your royalty\n\n\nThis model ensures the entire profit margin goes to you.\nAgain, use the Royalty calculator to view detailed estimations.\n\n\n\n\n💰 If a Bestseller Breakthrough Author Requests Royalty Payout\nIf you’ve opted for the Bestseller Breakthrough Package, you are entitled to request your royalty any time — there is no minimum payout threshold.\nSimply inform us through the helpdesk whenever you wish to receive your royalty payout. We will verify and process your request accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\nBestseller Breakthrough Package – Support & Deliverables\n\nWhen Will a Publishing Consultant Contact Me?\nIf you’ve chosen the Bestseller Breakthrough Package, a dedicated Publishing Consultant will get in touch with you within 5–7 business days from the date of your final submission.
