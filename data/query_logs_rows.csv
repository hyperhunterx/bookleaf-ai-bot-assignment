19,2025-10-25 10:35:50.893228+00,arjun.mehta@example.com,"How do royalties work?
",general_question,98,"Here's how royalties work at BookLeaf publishing, based on the information available:

**Royalty Structure:**
*   **eBook Royalty:** You receive 80% royalty on the net sale price of each eBook sold through the BookLeaf store, unless your package includes 100% royalty.
*   **Paperback Royalty:** This is calculated after deducting several costs from the selling price, including platform discounts, printing cost, GST, packaging and handling charges, and distribution and return expenses.

**Royalty Formula:**
The royalty you receive is based on the profit from each sale, not the book's listed price.
1.  **Selling Price ‚Äì Printing & Market Access Charges = Your Royalty Base**
2.  **Then:**
    *   If you're on the regular publishing model: you get 80% of this Royalty Base.
    *   If you're on the Bestseller Breakthrough Package: you get 100% of this Royalty Base.

**Understanding ""80% Royalty"":**
This means you receive 80% of the *profit earned* from each sale, after all mandatory costs are deducted. These deductions include printing cost, platform fees (e.g., Amazon's commission), GST and other taxes, handling and packaging, distribution & return costs, and platform discounts.
*   **Example:** If a book is listed at ‚Çπ150, and ‚Çπ40 goes to printing, and ‚Çπ45 is deducted by Amazon (for platform discount + fees + taxes), the remaining profit is ‚Çπ65. Your royalty would be 80% of ‚Çπ65, which is ‚Çπ52.

**Understanding ""100% Royalty"" (For Bestseller Breakthrough Authors Only):**
If you have the Bestseller Breakthrough Package, you receive 100% of the profit from each sale, after all mandatory costs are deducted. You still do not receive 100% of the listed price, as printing and platform costs still apply.
*   **Example:** If a book is listed at ‚Çπ150, and printing + taxes + fees total ‚Çπ60, the net profit is ‚Çπ90. You would receive ‚Çπ90 as your royalty.

**Royalty Calculator:**
You can use the Royalty Calculator available at `https://www.bookleafpub.in/printing-cost-royalty-calculator` for an accurate estimate of your earnings per copy.

**When and How You Receive Royalty Payments:**
*   **Minimum Thresholds:**
    *   For Indian authors: ‚Çπ2000
    *   For International authors: $100
*   **Claiming Royalty:** Once your earnings cross the minimum threshold, you need to inform BookLeaf via the helpdesk to initiate the transfer. After verification, you will receive a Razorpay payout link to your registered email address (check your inbox and spam/junk folders). You can then enter your UPI ID or bank account details to receive the payment.
*   **Payment Timeframe:** The payment can take anywhere from 1 minute to 24 hours to reflect in your account.
*   **Bestseller Breakthrough Package Authors:** Royalties are paid on-demand, meaning you can request a payout anytime after your book has been live for at least 30 business days. There is no minimum payout threshold for these authors."
